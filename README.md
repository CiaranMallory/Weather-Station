# Weather-Station
I created this program in 2nd Year of my Electronics Engineering Degree as part of a C Programming Module. 
The aim of the project was to write two programs. 

The First program would receive data from an Arduino Weather Station that had been built as part of another Electronics Engineering Module. The program would write this data to a binary file and save it on the local computer.

The Second program would then be used to interpret this data and manipulate and display the data in different forms.
